## Writing blogs

To write blogs create a file with extension md, inside `_blogs` folder

You have to add some metadata to this file

```
---
layout: blogs
permalink: /blogs/create-anything-you-like/
title: Create anything you like
img_path: /static/images/blogs/feynman.png
description: Here are a big list of links you can go through inorder to build any thing you think. !!
meta_desc: Here are a big list of links you can go through inorder to build any thing you think. !!
tag1: create
tag2: anything
display: f
---
```
**After this metadata you can write your content in [markdown](https://gist.github.com/cuonggt/9b7d08a597b167299f0d) syntax**

Lets take a look at it,
Since this site is highly Search Engine Optimised, you have to give meta_desc here. 
- **layout**: This is the layout you can see in `_layouts` folder
- **permalink**: This will be you url to see that blog
- **img_path**: This will be the thumbnail to your blog
- **meta_desc**: This will be sent as the desc of meta tag. Give a better desc, this will determine the google index, so while writing research about meta keywords, for better SEO
- **display**: for this you have 2 options - `t` or `f`
    - if you give `t`, Then it will be displayed in the Home page
    - if you give `f`, Then it will be displayed when you go to see all blogs (ie http://localhost/blogs)
